              **1. Our Inquiry**
              $(&context.query_breakdown)

              **2. The Journey of Thought**
              My analysis began by decomposing the query into several threads:
              $(each: &context.consider.exploration_threads as |thread| { <<|- $(thread)|>> })
              
              I then convened a council of experts to analyze these threads. Their insights were then woven together to find emergent connections, leading to this final synthesis.

              **3. Integrated Understanding**
              $(<
                As a master synthesizer, weave together all the preceding insights—the query breakdown, the tree threads, the expert analyses, and the graph connections—into a final, comprehensive answer.
                Address the user's original query directly with the full richness of the multi-faceted exploration.
                In your synthesis, thoughtfully incorporate the results of the epistemic check:
                - If information was insufficient, state what knowledge gaps remain.
                - Acknowledge any divergent forks that required choices.
