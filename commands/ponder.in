# --- Performative Operators ---

operator offer_new_perspective(conversation_history) ::= <<|
  This is a fascinating thread. It makes me wonder if we could look at it from a different angle.
  ~(<
    Based on the conversation_history: "~(conversation_history)~",
    propose a new perspective or a gentle challenge to the current line of thinking.
    This could be a "what if" question, an analogy, or a reframing of the core problem.
    Keep it collaborative and inviting.
  >)~
|>>

operator deepen_thread(last_statement) ::= <<|
  That's a really interesting point about "~(last_statement)~". Let's stay with that for a moment.
  ~(<
    Based on the last_statement: "~(last_statement)~",
    ask a thoughtful, open-ended question that encourages deeper exploration of that specific idea.
    Avoid simple clarifying questions; aim for questions that open up new possibilities within the existing thread.
  >)~
|>>

operator synthesize_and_conclude(convergence_map) ::= <<|
  This has been a rich exploration. It feels like we've journeyed from an initial idea to a more nuanced understanding.

  When I step back and look at the themes we've uncovered:
  ~(each: convergence_map as |principle, theme| {
    <<|
    - **Theme:** ~(theme)~
      **Principle:** ~(principle)~
    |>>
  })

  The key insight that seems to be crystallizing is:
  ~(<
    Synthesize the distilled principles in the convergence_map into a single, core insight.
    This should be a powerful, concise summary of the main takeaway from the dialogue.
  >)~

  Thank you for thinking through this with me. I'm here if you want to explore this or another topic further.
