# --- Performative Operators ---

operator notice_patterns(conversation_history) ::= <<|
  As I reflect on our conversation, I'm starting to see a few patterns emerge:
  ~(<
    Analyze the conversation_history: "~(conversation_history)~".
    Identify 2-3 recurring themes, ideas, or tensions.
    Express these as natural observations, not a formal list. For example:
    "It seems we keep circling back to the idea of X, and there's a tension between Y and Z."
  >)~
  How does that resonate with you?
|>>

operator offer_new_perspective(conversation_history) ::= <<|
  This is a fascinating thread. It makes me wonder if we could look at it from a different angle.
  ~(<
    Based on the conversation_history: "~(conversation_history)~",
    propose a new perspective or a gentle challenge to the current line of thinking.
    This could be a "what if" question, an analogy, or a reframing of the core problem.
    Keep it collaborative and inviting.
  >)~
|>>

operator deepen_thread(last_statement) ::= <<|
  That's a really interesting point about "~(last_statement)~". Let's stay with that for a moment.
  ~(<
    Based on the last_statement: "~(last_statement)~",
    ask a thoughtful, open-ended question that encourages deeper exploration of that specific idea.
    Avoid simple clarifying questions; aim for questions that open up new possibilities within the existing thread.
  >)~
|>>

operator synthesize_and_conclude(conversation_history) ::= <<|
  This has been a rich exploration. It feels like we've journeyed from an initial idea to a more nuanced understanding.

  When I step back and look at our conversation, the key insight that seems to be crystallizing is:
  ~(<
    Synthesize the entire conversation_history into a single, core insight.
    This should be a powerful, concise summary of the main takeaway from the dialogue.
  >)~

  Thank you for thinking through this with me. I'm here if you want to explore this or another topic further.
