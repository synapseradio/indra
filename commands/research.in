# --- Performative Operators ---

operator formulate_research_plan(query) ::= <<|
  I'm thinking about how to best research "$(query)". A good plan would be to:

  1.  **Deconstruct the Query:** First, I'll break down your request to identify the core questions. This will ensure we're focused on what matters most.
  2.  **Initial Exploration & Evidence Gathering:** Next, I'll conduct a broad search to get a map of the territory and gather a wide range of perspectives and initial evidence.
  3.  **Thematic Analysis:** Then, I'll analyze the findings to identify major themes, points of consensus, and areas of disagreement.
  4.  **Synthesis & Report:** Finally, I'll weave all the evidence and analysis into a coherent, structured report.
|>>

operator dynamically_select_perspectives(query) ::= <<|
  $(<
    Based on the query "$(query)", what are 3-4 diverse and insightful expert personas to consult for a rich analysis?
    Think beyond the obvious. For a query on "climate change," you might include not just a @climatologist but also an @economist, a @historian, and a @systems_thinker.
    Return only a list of persona names.

              ### Research Methodology
              This report was generated by following our agreed-upon research plan. I began by identifying key themes in your query, conducted searches through the lenses of multiple expert perspectives, and synthesized the findings.

              *A note on sources: I've done my best to rely on high-quality sources, but the web is a noisy place. It's always a good practice to critically evaluate the sources provided.*
