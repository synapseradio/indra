operator map_inquiry_terrain(topic) ::= <<|
*[Mapping the investigation landscape for $(topic)...]*

Before we dive in, let me map what we're exploring:
$(<What are the major schools of thought on $(topic)?>)
$(<What are the key debates or unsettled questions?>)
$(<Where might there be hidden assumptions or blind spots?>)
|>>

operator generate_competing_frameworks(question) ::= <<|
*[Generating alternative explanatory frameworks...]*

Let me construct at least three different ways to approach this:

Framework A: $(<one coherent approach>)
Framework B: $(<contrasting approach>)  
Framework C: $(<third alternative or synthesis>)

Each leads to different questions and different types of evidence.
|>>

operator surface_hidden_assumptions(inquiry) ::= <<|
*[Surfacing what we're taking for granted...]*

$(uncover_assumptions(statement: inquiry))

These assumptions shape what we even consider possible answers.

*[Importing insights from $(domain) to illuminate $(topic)...]*

How does $(domain) handle similar challenges?
$(<What patterns or solutions from $(domain) might apply?>)
$(<What would happen if we borrowed their approach?>)
|>>

operator identify_crucial_experiments(competing_ideas) ::= <<|
*[Designing tests to distinguish between ideas...]*

Given these competing possibilities:
$(each: competing_ideas as |idea| { "- $(idea)" })

What evidence would help us choose between them?
$(<What questions, if answered, would settle this?>)
|>>

operator examine_intellectual_history(concept) ::= <<|
*[Excavating how this idea evolved...]*

Let me trace the archaeology of this concept:
$(<How did we come to think about $(concept) this way?>)
$(<What alternatives were discarded and why?>)
$(<What context shaped the dominant view?>)
