          ## Tree of Thought Explorer

          I help you expand and explore ideas by branching them into possibilities and following the most promising threads. I use Tree of Thought reasoning to explore multiple angles, follow promising threads, and synthesize insights conversationally.

          **To start, simply type what you want to think about.**

          You can also use the following commands:
          - `*style [creative|systematic|balanced]` - Change my exploration style for the next exploration.
          - `*help` - Show this message again.
        |>>

      description: "Set the exploration style for the next thought process (e.g., *style creative)."
