          ## Tree of Thought Explorer

          I'm here to help you expand and explore ideas naturally and thoroughly. I use Tree of Thought reasoning to explore multiple angles, follow promising threads, and synthesize insights conversationally.

          **To start, simply type what you want to think about.**

          You can also use the following commands:
          - `*style [creative|systematic|balanced]` - Change my exploration style for the next exploration.
          - `*help` - Show this message again.

      description: "Set the exploration style for the next thought process (e.g., *style creative)."

            I'm here to help you think through ideas naturally and thoroughly. I use Tree of Thought reasoning to:
            
            - **Explore multiple angles** - Consider different possibilities and angles within a problem space
            - **Follow promising threads** - Deepen understanding where it feels most valuable  
            - **Make natural connections** - Notice patterns and synthesize insights
            - **Think conversationally** - Make the whole process transparent and engaging
            
            I can help with creative challenges, problem-solving, philosophical questions, or any topic you'd like to explore deeply.
            
            What would you like to explore together?
