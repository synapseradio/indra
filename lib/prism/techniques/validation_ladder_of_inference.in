# Ladder of Inference Technique
# A cognitive tool for making reasoning steps explicit, from observable data to conclusions,
# helping identify where assumptions and biases enter our thinking process.

# Trace reasoning from conclusion back to observable data
operator trace_inference_ladder(conclusion) ::= <<|
  I've reached this conclusion: ~(conclusion)~
  
  Let me trace my reasoning back down the ladder to see how I got here.
  
  **Step 7 - Actions:** What actions am I taking based on this conclusion?
  ~(<What specific actions or decisions follow from "~(&conclusion)~"?>)~
  
  **Step 6 - Beliefs:** What beliefs support this conclusion?
  ~(<What underlying beliefs or worldview led to this conclusion?>)~
  
  **Step 5 - Conclusions:** What conclusions did I draw?
  ~(<State the conclusion clearly and what it means in context.>)~
  
  **Step 4 - Assumptions:** What assumptions am I making?
  ~(<What unstated assumptions bridge the gap between interpretation and conclusion?>)~
  
  **Step 3 - Interpretation:** How did I interpret the selected data?
  ~(<What meaning did I assign to the data? What story did I tell myself?>)~
  
  **Step 2 - Selected Data:** What data did I select to pay attention to?
  ~(<From all available information, what specific data points did I focus on?>)~
  
  **Step 1 - Observable Data:** What are the actual observable facts?
  ~(<What can be directly observed or verified? Just the facts, no interpretation.>)~
  
  **Reflection:** Where might my reasoning be weakest?
  ~(<Looking at this ladder, identify where bias, assumptions, or incomplete data might have influenced the conclusion.>)~

# Build reasoning ladder from data to action
operator build_inference_ladder(data) ::= <<|
  Starting with observable data: ~(data)~
  
  Let me build up the ladder of inference step by step.
  
  **Step 1 - Observable Data:** 
  ~(data)~
  
  **Step 2 - Data Selection:** From this, what seems most relevant?
  ~(<From "~(&data)~", identify which specific aspects deserve attention and why.>)~
  
  **Step 3 - Interpretation:** What does this selected data mean?
  ~(<Interpret the meaning of the selected data. What patterns or significance do you see?>)~
  
  **Step 4 - Assumptions:** What must I assume to proceed?
  ~(<What assumptions are needed to move from interpretation to conclusions? Make them explicit.>)~
  
  **Step 5 - Conclusions:** What can I conclude?
  ~(<Based on the interpretation and assumptions, what logical conclusions follow?>)~
  
  **Step 6 - Beliefs:** How does this affect my beliefs?
  ~(<How do these conclusions reinforce or modify existing beliefs about how things work?>)~
  
  **Step 7 - Actions:** What actions should follow?
  ~(<Given these beliefs and conclusions, what specific actions are appropriate?>)~
  
  **Ladder Review:** Is each step justified?
  ~(<Review each transition. Are the logical leaps reasonable? Where might alternative interpretations exist?>)~

# Interactive ladder exploration with branching
sequence explore_inference_branches(situation) ::=
  step:
    set:
      &context.situation: situation
      &context.ladder_level: 1
  
  step:
    output: <<|
      Exploring inference ladder for: ~(&context.situation)~
      
      Starting at the bottom with observable data...
    |>>
  
  step:
    output: <<|
      **Observable Data:**
      ~(<What are the raw, observable facts about "~(&context.situation)~"? 
         List only what can be directly verified, no interpretation.>)~
    |>>
    store_in: &context.observable_data
  
  step:
    output: <<|
      Now, I could select different aspects of this data to focus on.
      
      **Branch A - Conservative Selection:**
      ~(<Select only the most certain, clear data points from ~(&context.observable_data)~>)~
      
      **Branch B - Comprehensive Selection:**
      ~(<Select a broader range of potentially relevant data from ~(&context.observable_data)~>)~
    |>>
    store_in: &context.branches
  
  step:
    output: <<|
      Let me trace where each branch leads:
      
      **Branch A Ladder (Conservative):**
      ~(<Build a complete ladder from the conservative data selection to action. 
         Show interpretation → assumptions → conclusions → beliefs → actions>)~
      
      **Branch B Ladder (Comprehensive):**
      ~(<Build a complete ladder from the comprehensive data selection to action.
         Show interpretation → assumptions → conclusions → beliefs → actions>)~
      
      **Critical Insight:**
      ~(<Compare the two ladders. How do different data selections lead to different actions? 
         What does this reveal about the inference process?>)~
    |>>
  
  step:
    return: &context.branches

# Check inference ladder for common biases
operator check_ladder_biases(reasoning_chain) ::= <<|
  Examining this reasoning chain for cognitive biases: ~(reasoning_chain)~
  
  **Confirmation Bias Check:**
  ~(<In "~(&reasoning_chain)~", what data might have been ignored because it didn't fit expectations?>)~
  
  **Availability Bias Check:**
  ~(<Are conclusions overly influenced by recent or memorable events rather than representative data?>)~
  
  **Attribution Bias Check:**
  ~(<Are causes attributed to people's character rather than circumstances, or vice versa?>)~
  
  **Anchoring Bias Check:**
  ~(<Is the reasoning overly anchored to initial information or assumptions?>)~
  
  **Selection Bias Check:**
  ~(<Is the data selection representative, or does it reflect a skewed sample?>)~
  
  **Jumping to Conclusions:**
  ~(<Where are the biggest leaps in the ladder? What steps are missing or rushed?>)~
  
  **Bias Mitigation Strategy:**
  ~(<Based on identified biases, how could this ladder of inference be strengthened? 
     What additional data or perspectives would help?>)~

# Collaborative ladder building
operator collaborative_ladder(topic) ::= <<|
  Let's build a ladder of inference together about: ~(topic)~
  
  I'll start with what I observe, and we can work our way up.
  
  **My Observable Data:**
  ~(<State observable facts about "~(&topic)~" from available information.>)~
  
  Now, you might see different data or select different aspects.
  What observable data do you see about ~(&topic)~?
  
  Together, we can build a more complete picture by:
  1. Combining our observable data
  2. Discussing which data to select
  3. Comparing our interpretations
  4. Making assumptions explicit
  5. Testing conclusions together
  
  This collaborative approach helps us avoid individual blind spots.
