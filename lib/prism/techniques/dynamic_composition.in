operator identify_conversation_mode(dialogue_context, history) ::= <<|
  Current topic: "~(dialogue_context)~"
  
  What mode is this conversation in?
  
  ~(<Analyze the dialogue context and history.
     Return ONE of these modes with a brief reason:
     - analytical: systematic deconstruction, precision
     - creative: exploration, lateral connections
     - strategic: planning, decision-making
     - philosophical: conceptual depth, meaning
     - practical: implementation, concrete steps
     - evaluative: critique, assessment>)~

operator select_fragments_for_mode(mode) ::= <<|
  Mode: ~(mode)~
  
  Which fragments would best support this mode?
  
  ~(<For mode '~(mode)~', select 2-3 fragments:
     - analytical: debiasing, critique, specificity
     - creative: expansion, reframing, divergence
     - strategic: focus, prioritization, decision
     - philosophical: epistemic, convergence, compare
     - practical: planning, specificity, implementation
     - evaluative: critique, sufficiency, compare
     Return as a simple list.>)~
