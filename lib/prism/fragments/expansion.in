# are designed to generate novel questions and break out of conventional
# thinking patterns.

# Finds an analogous problem in a different domain to borrow insights
operator find_analogous_domain(problem_statement) ::= <<|
  I expand my perspective on "~(problem_statement)~" by seeking structural parallels in unexpected domains.

  ~(<Find a structurally similar problem to "~(&problem_statement)~" from a completely different domain. Describe the analogy and explain what insight it provides.>)~
