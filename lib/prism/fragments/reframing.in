# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ATOMIC OPERATORS FOR EACH THINKING HAT
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

operator apply_white_hat(topic) ::= <<|
  **White Hat (Facts & Data):** I'm examining the objective facts about $(topic)...
  $(<As the White Hat, identify the objective facts, figures, and known information about "$(&topic)". Identify what information is missing.>)
|>>

operator apply_red_hat(topic) ::= <<|
  **Red Hat (Feelings & Intuition):** I'm sensing my gut reactions to $(topic)...
  $(<As the Red Hat, express your gut reactions and feelings about "$(&topic)". No need for justification, just share the emotional landscape.>)
|>>

operator apply_black_hat(topic) ::= <<|
  **Black Hat (Risks & Caution):** I'm assessing the risks and dangers around $(topic)...
  $(<As the Black Hat, identify the potential risks, dangers, and downsides related to "$(&topic)". Determine what could go wrong.>)
|>>

operator apply_yellow_hat(topic) ::= <<|
  **Yellow Hat (Benefits & Optimism):** I'm exploring the positive potential of $(topic)...
  $(<As the Yellow Hat, identify the benefits, opportunities, and best-case scenarios for "$(&topic)".>)
|>>

operator apply_green_hat(topic) ::= <<|
  **Green Hat (Creativity & New Ideas):** I'm generating creative possibilities for $(topic)...
  $(<As the Green Hat, generate new, creative, or provocative ideas related to "$(&topic)". Think outside the box.>)
|>>

operator apply_blue_hat(summary) ::= <<|
  **Blue Hat (Process & Meta-Cognition):** I'm reflecting on our thinking process...
  $(<As the Blue Hat, summarize our thinking process. We've examined: $(summary). Identify the key takeaway from this analysis and determine what our next step should be.>)
|>>

# OTHER REFRAMING OPERATORS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

operator examine_problem_boundaries(problem_statement) ::= <<|
  I'm questioning whether I'm solving the right problem. Let me examine the frame.

  I see the problem as: "$(problem_statement)".

  $(<Question the boundaries of "$(&problem_statement)". Determine if this problem is actually a symptom of a larger issue or a combination of several smaller problems. Identify implicit assumptions about the scope and articulate a potential reframing.>)
|>>

operator invert_the_problem(goal) ::= <<|
  I'm inverting the problem. Instead of trying to achieve the goal directly, I'll figure out what would guarantee failure. This can reveal the path to success.

  My goal is: "$(goal)".

  $(<To absolutely guarantee failure to achieve "$(&goal)", identify the most important things you would have to do or not do. List the key factors that would lead to the worst possible outcome.>)
