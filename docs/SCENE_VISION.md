# SCENE Engine: Unified Behavioral Architecture with Computational Context Overlays

## Vision

SCENE (Sequenced Contexts Enabling Narrative Execution) represents a unified behavioral specification engine that combines performative computation paradigms with dynamic computational contexts. By treating language as directly executable and context as a first-class architectural concern, SCENE enables AI systems to adapt their problem-solving stance while maintaining consistent behavioral semantics.

## Core Innovation: Computational Contexts as Defining Feature

SCENE's defining innovation lies in its orthogonal computational context system. Rather than requiring extensive parameter tuning across states, SCENE provides single-point behavioral modification through context overlays:

```yaml
# Traditional approach: Fixed behavior per state
REASON → produces expert dialogue with standard parameters

# SCENE approach: Same state, different computational stances
SCENE_FORENSIC + REASON → paranoid expert verification
SCENE_EMERGENCY + REASON → rapid expert consensus
SCENE_CREATIVE + REASON → exploratory ideation
```

This enables specialists to rapidly switch between problem-solving modes:
- **Forensic investigation** with paranoid verification
- **Emergency response** with rapid triage
- **Creative exploration** with high tolerance for uncertainty
- **Production deployment** with conservative validation

## Theoretical Foundations

### Unified Reasoning Through Behavioral State Machines

Research into modern reasoning engines reveals sophisticated integration patterns that inform SCENE's architecture:

**Cognitive Architecture Patterns**: Among 84 documented cognitive architectures, iterative working memory updates through sustained firing and associative chain formation align directly with SCENE's INIT→CONTEXT→REASON→SYNTHESIS→IMPLEMENT flow. Systems like ACT-R and SOAR demonstrate production system architectures that SCENE extends through computational context overlays.

**State Machine Workflows**: Salesforce's Atlas Reasoning Engine achieves sub-3% hallucination rates through declarative YAML configuration and event-driven workflows. SCENE builds on this foundation by adding context-aware execution modes that preserve state flow while modifying behavioral parameters.

### Performative Computation: Language as Direct Execution

SCENE embodies performative computation where language utterances directly perform calculations:

**Speech Act Theory in Computation**: Following J.L. Austin's framework, SCENE specifications (locutionary acts) express computational intent through semantic frameworks (illocutionary acts) to produce execution results (perlocutionary acts). This makes instructions "irresistible" - they cannot help but execute.

**Schema-as-Execution**: Like Executable UML and constraint programming systems, SCENE schemas ARE the execution. Behavioral specifications in YAML directly manifest as computational behavior without intermediate compilation steps. Prolog's inference-based execution and Attempto Controlled English demonstrate this paradigm's maturity.

### Language-Oriented Architecture

SCENE adopts language workbench patterns for maximum flexibility:

**Domain-Specific Language Composition**: Following successful YAML-based DSLs like Ansible and Kubernetes, SCENE uses hierarchical structure with meaningful domain concepts. The addition of computational contexts extends this pattern - each context becomes a behavioral DSL overlay.

**Multi-Language Integration**: Research into JetBrains MPS and Racket's #lang mechanism informs SCENE's ability to compose multiple behavioral languages through context switching. Each scene effectively creates a new behavioral dialect while preserving core semantics.

## Technical Architecture

### Hybrid Implementation Strategy

**Parsing and Analysis**: SCENE employs Tree-sitter for incremental parsing with sub-100ms response times, combined with ANTLR for semantic analysis. This hybrid approach enables real-time behavioral updates as contexts change.

**Reference Resolution**: Hierarchical symbol tables with O(1) lookup performance support cross-scene reference tracking. Multi-pass resolution separates declaration collection, reference resolution, and semantic validation - crucial for context overlay application.

### Context Overlay System

```yaml
x-scene: &scene
  # Core registry of computational stances
  registry: [
    SCENE_NORMAL,      # Balanced default behavior
    SCENE_DIAGNOSTIC,  # Methodical investigation
    SCENE_FORENSIC,    # Paranoid verification
    SCENE_EMERGENCY,   # Rapid response
    SCENE_CREATIVE     # Exploratory thinking
  ]
  
  # Context application semantics
  application:
    formula: "state_behavior × scene_modifier = actual_behavior"
    preserves: ["state_flow", "core_mechanics", "output_contracts"]
    
  # Example: Forensic context
  scenes:
    SCENE_FORENSIC:
      computational_stance:
        trust_level: 0.1
        verification_depth: "exhaustive"
        assumption_tolerance: 0.0
      
      modifies:
        dynamics.uncertainty.threshold: 0.3
        verify.parallel_paths: 5
        mechanics.trust.domains: [".gov", ".edu"]
```

### Cross-Model Consistency Through Contexts

SCENE achieves consistent behavior across AI models through structured context application:

**Template Standardization**: Each scene defines standardized behavioral templates that reduce output variation. Context overlays ensure consistent interpretation regardless of underlying model capabilities.

**Multi-Path Verification**: Scenes can spawn parallel verification paths with self-consistency checking. This reduces hallucination while maintaining performance through intelligent caching and prompt compression.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Engine with Context Support
- Establish LSP with Tree-sitter syntax highlighting
- Implement scene registry and transition mechanics
- Create parameter overlay system with proper precedence

### Phase 2: Behavioral Semantics
- Add semantic analysis with context-aware validation
- Implement cross-scene reference resolution
- Enable dynamic scene transitions during execution

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Scene composition for blended contexts
- Conditional scene activation based on uncertainty metrics
- Context-specific activity streams and side effects

## Benefits of Unified Architecture

1. **Rapid Behavioral Adaptation**: Single command changes entire computational stance
2. **Separation of Concerns**: States define "what", scenes define "how"
3. **Enhanced Testability**: Same workflows tested under different contexts
4. **Intuitive Mental Model**: Specialists understand "same process, different mode"
5. **Scalable Complexity**: Avoids parameter explosion through orthogonal contexts

## Future Vision

SCENE's architecture enables evolution toward:

- **Adaptive Context Learning**: Scenes that tune parameters based on outcomes
- **Domain-Specific Context Libraries**: Specialized scenes for legal, medical, engineering
- **Multi-Context Composition**: Weighted blending of multiple computational stances
- **Autonomous Context Switching**: AI recognizes when to change problem-solving mode

## Conclusion

SCENE represents a convergence of mature technologies - cognitive architectures' state patterns, performative computation's direct execution, and language-oriented programming's composability - unified through the novel abstraction of computational contexts. By making context a first-class architectural concern, SCENE enables AI systems that adapt fluidly to different problem-solving needs while maintaining behavioral consistency and cross-model reliability.

The key insight is that behavioral modification should be orthogonal to state flow. This separation enables specialists to work with AI systems that think differently based on context - paranoid when investigating security breaches, rapid when responding to emergencies, creative when exploring solutions - all through the same fundamental state machine enhanced by computational context overlays.
