# Introduction: Giving Form to Thought

There is a space between a fleeting insight and a fully-formed idea. It’s a space of intuition, of tangled connections and nascent structures. Articulating the insights found there—giving them form and clarity—is a craft.

INDRA is a tool designed for that craft.

It is a protocol for making the implicit movements of thought explicit and composable. It uses Large Language Models as a powerful, responsive medium for expression—an instrument for what is called **Accelerated Inference**. INDRA provides a way to choreograph a thinking process, then use the scale of an inference engine to see where the designed patterns might lead.

## The Shape of an Idea

Using INDRA gives a thinking process a tangible form. This form has a few simple, core components:

*   **Actors (`@name`):** A thought process can be given a voice, a center of agency. An Actor is a component that can perform actions and guide the flow of a conversation.
*   **Personas (`@name`):** An Actor can adopt different perspectives or modes of thinking. A Persona is a reusable set of traits—like a mask or a lens—that an Actor can wear for a specific task.
*   **Operators (`name()`):** These are the fundamental "verbs" of cognition, the atomic moves in a thinking process, like `wonder_about()` or `check_assumptions()`.
*   **Sequences:** These operators can be composed into sequences, choreographing a simple hunch into a multi-step journey of discovery.

Assembling these components in an `.in` file describes a cognitive architecture—a shape of thought—that the LLM then inhabits and brings to life.

## An Invitation

This approach is one of design and discovery. It is a quiet, focused practice of giving form to the way one thinks, and then exploring the new territory that process reveals.

The protocol is in its early days. For those who find this approach resonant, the documentation and examples are an invitation to explore.
