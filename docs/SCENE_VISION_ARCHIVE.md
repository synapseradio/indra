# Behavioral Architectures and Programming Language Design for the SCENE Engine (Archive)

This comprehensive research report synthesizes findings on behavioral architectures, cognitive frameworks, and programming language design patterns relevant to the SCENE engine specification (originally called LOVE). The investigation reveals significant advancements in unified reasoning systems, performative computation paradigms, and cross-model consistency techniques that can inform SCENE's architecture.

## Unified reasoning engines show promising alignment with SCENE's architecture

Modern reasoning engines demonstrate sophisticated integration of computation, language, and cognition through state machine-based workflows. **Salesforce's Atlas Reasoning Engine (2024)** implements "System 2" inference-time reasoning with declarative YAML configuration and asynchronous, event-driven workflows that significantly reduce hallucinations from 3-27% baseline to under 3%. The **Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA) Framework** bridges classical cognitive architectures with modern LLM capabilities through modular memory components and structured action spaces.

Among 84 documented cognitive architectures with 49 actively developed systems, several patterns emerge that align with SCENE's INIT→CONTEXT→REASON→SYNTHESIS→IMPLEMENT flow. ACT-R and SOAR provide production system architectures with rule-based cognitive processing, while hybrid systems like CLARION combine implicit neural networks with explicit symbolic knowledge layers. These architectures demonstrate **iterative working memory updates** through sustained firing, synaptic potentiation, and associative chain formation - patterns directly applicable to SCENE's behavioral semantics.

## Performative computation enables direct language execution

Research into performative computation frameworks reveals mature paradigms where language utterances directly perform calculations. **Prolog represents the most established example**, where logical statements execute through inference without distinguishing between specification and implementation. Constraint programming extends this concept - constraint specifications directly solve problems through refinement and perturbation models.

The theoretical foundation stems from J.L. Austin's speech act theory, which maps naturally to computational contexts where specifications (locutionary acts) express computational intent through semantic frameworks (illocutionary acts) to produce execution results (perlocutionary acts). **Executable UML demonstrates schema-as-execution** through Platform-Independent Models that execute without implementation details, proving that models can BE applications rather than blueprints.

Modern implementations include controlled natural languages like Attempto Controlled English (ACE) where statements like "Every customer that has a gold card and lives in Europe can buy an item with a discount of 5 percent" directly generate executable business rules. This research strongly supports SCENE's goal of making instructions "irresistible" through performative language design.

## Language-oriented programming provides architectural patterns for SCENE

Martin Fowler's language workbench concept provides a foundation for building systems around collections of domain-specific languages. **Contemporary workbenches demonstrate key capabilities**: Spoofax uses declarative specifications with SDF3 for syntax and Statix for static semantics; JetBrains MPS enables projectional editing without parsing; Racket's #lang mechanism allows seamless language composition.

For YAML-based DSLs specifically, successful implementations like Ansible Playbooks and Kubernetes manifests demonstrate human-readable declarative specifications with rich semantic validation. **JSON Schema integration enables comprehensive IDE support** through validation, auto-completion, and documentation. The research identifies critical patterns: meaningful key names reflecting domain concepts, hierarchical structure for logical grouping, and consistent naming conventions that minimize quoting requirements.

Behavioral DSL patterns emerge from examining state machine DSLs, rule-based systems, and workflow languages. Event-Condition-Action rules provide reactive behavior specification, while compositional patterns enable behavior hierarchies with priority-based coordination and conflict resolution - directly applicable to SCENE's behavioral architecture.

## LSP implementation requires hybrid parsing strategies

Language Server Protocol implementation for behavioral DSLs benefits from a **hybrid approach combining Tree-sitter for incremental parsing with ANTLR for semantic analysis**. Tree-sitter provides true incremental parsing with robust error recovery and structural sharing, achieving sub-100ms response times for basic requests. ANTLR enables sophisticated semantic actions through attribute grammars and embedded code blocks within grammar rules.

Reference resolution architecture requires hierarchical symbol tables with scope-based resolution, cross-reference databases for persistent symbol management, and lazy resolution strategies that resolve symbols on-demand. **Multi-pass resolution architectures** separate declaration collection, reference resolution, and semantic validation into distinct phases, enabling efficient incremental updates.

Performance optimization relies on structural sharing in parse trees, selective re-parsing based on change analysis, and parallel parsing for independent modules. Memory management through garbage collection of unused symbols and efficient diff algorithms ensures scalability for large codebases.

## Cross-model instruction consistency demands structured approaches

Achieving consistent instruction interpretation across AI/LLM models requires systematic techniques. **Instruction fine-tuning (IFT)** bridges the gap between next-word prediction and instruction following, while multi-task learning on diverse datasets (15M+ examples in FLAN) generalizes capabilities. Alignment techniques including RLHF, Direct Preference Optimization, and Constitutional AI ensure consistent behavior.

Prompt engineering strategies prove essential: system prompting establishes persistent behavioral frameworks; self-consistency decoding generates multiple reasoning paths and selects the most coherent; Chain-of-Thought prompting reduces hallucination through explicit step-by-step reasoning. **Template-based approaches with standardized structures** reduce output variation across models.

Cross-model robustness requires format standardization with consistent delimiters, prompt compression to reduce token counts by 40% while maintaining performance, and multi-turn memory management through layered context building. These techniques directly support SCENE's goal of making instructions maximally consistent across different AI models.

## Reference condensation relies on proven compiler techniques

Symbol resolution algorithms from compiler design provide efficient patterns for reference management. **Hash table implementations achieve O(1) average lookup time**, while hierarchical scope management handles nested contexts. Alpha-renaming eliminates variable shadowing issues and enables aggressive optimization.

Cross-file reference techniques include link-time optimization for whole-program analysis, global symbol tables for cross-module references, and dependency graph construction with topological sorting. IDE implementations demonstrate performance through indexed symbol databases, incremental updates processing only changed files, and cache-based resolution with LRU eviction.

Domain-specific optimizations include meta-compilation techniques like the Deegen framework for automatic VM generation, embedded DSL patterns leveraging host language type safety, and performance optimizations through register pinning and inline caching.

## Architectural recommendations for SCENE engine implementation

Based on this research, the SCENE engine should adopt a **hybrid architecture combining declarative YAML specifications with embedded behavioral semantics**. The semantic model should provide rich behavioral abstractions including states, events, actions, and conditions with compositional building blocks and runtime adaptation capabilities.

Implementation should proceed in phases: Phase 1 establishes core LSP features with Tree-sitter syntax highlighting and basic autocompletion; Phase 2 adds semantic analysis with component dependency validation and asset reference resolution; Phase 3 introduces advanced features including cross-scene reference tracking and Lua script integration.

The reference system architecture requires hierarchical symbol tables with O(1) lookup performance, incremental resolution engines with change detection, and cross-reference management for import/export mapping. Cross-model consistency demands standardized instruction templates, multi-model validation through self-consistency checking, and performance optimization through prompt compression and caching.

## Conclusion

This research reveals a convergence of mature technologies and patterns that strongly support the SCENE engine's vision. The combination of cognitive architectures' state machine patterns, performative computation's direct execution paradigms, language-oriented programming's compositional approaches, and modern LSP implementation techniques provides a solid foundation for creating a unified behavioral specification language that is both powerful and accessible. The key to success lies in carefully balancing expressive power with usability while maintaining performance through incremental processing and intelligent caching strategies.
