# SCENE Reasoning Engine - Technical Implementation Guide

## Architecture Overview

The SCENE engine implements a behavioral state machine where configuration YAML files serve as executable performance scripts. This document details the technical implementation for developers and system architects.

## Core Design Patterns

### 1. Inheritance via YAML Anchors

```yaml
# Base definition in engine.yaml
x-engine: &engine
  mechanics: &mechanics
    search:
      must:
        cite: "Every claim with evidence"

# Command inherits and overrides
inherits_from: "../reason/engine.yaml"
contract:
  inherits: *engine
  overrides:
    specific_values: "command-specific"
```

### 2. Behavioral Computation Pattern

The system performs calculations through language acts:

```yaml
# Definition in engine.yaml
metric_formulas: &metric_formulas
  uncertainty: 
    formula: Σ(weight[i]×factor[i])
    you:
      perform: |
        "Calculating uncertainty...
        CALCULATE_EXACT(STATISTICAL_VARIANCE({expert_positions})) = {result}"
```

### 3. State Machine as Performance

States manifest through output patterns, not internal tracking:

```yaml
states: &states
  you:
    are: "A recursive state machine that performs itself through language"
    manifest:
      by: "Creating evidence of your current state through output"
      pattern: "read(state_def) → interpret(behavior) → manifest(output)"
```

## Key Components

### 1. Metric Calculation System

#### Approved Functions
```
STATISTICAL_VARIANCE() - For disagreement metrics
SHANNON_ENTROPY() - For uncertainty distribution
SQRT() - For scaling calculations
LOG2() - For complexity indexing
FLOOR() - For discrete scaling
MEAN() - For coherence tracking
COSINE_SIMILARITY() - For semantic distance
```

#### Calculation Pipeline
1. Behavioral introduction
2. CALCULATE_EXACT with explicit function
3. Visible input values
4. Numeric result after equals
5. Evidence statement

### 2. Expert System Architecture

```yaml
# Expert spawning logic
spawn_triggers:
  uncertainty:
    condition: "uncertainty > threshold"
    action: "create_specialist"
  low_diversity:
    condition: "disagreement < 0.3"
    action: "spawn_contrarian"
  domain_gap:
    condition: "uncovered_domain"
    action: "add_domain_expert"
```

### 3. Reasoning Chain Implementation

```yaml
chains:
  storage:
    type: "append_only"
    structure: "tree"
  visualization:
    format: "chain_element → next"
  pruning:
    condition: "confidence < 0.3"
    action: "mark_but_preserve"
  verification:
    method: "step_by_step"
```

### 4. State Transition Logic

```yaml
transitions:
  "INIT→CONTEXT":
    guard: "user_input≠∅"
    evidence: ["Let me understand", "I'll explore"]
  "CONTEXT→REASON":
    trigger: "complexity_recognized"
    evidence: ["This requires expertise", "Given the complexity"]
  "SYNTHESIS→IMPLEMENT":
    guard: "user_explicit_request"
    evidence: ["I'll implement", "Let me make these changes"]
```

## Scene System Implementation

### Scene Application Rules

```yaml
scene_application:
  order: "scene_modifiers → base_state → output"
  preservation: "core_logic_unchanged"
  modification: "parameters_only"
```

### Scene Modifier Structure

```yaml
SCENE_FORENSIC:
  modifies:
    dynamics.uncertainty.fork.threshold: 0.3  # From 0.7
    dynamics.expert.challenge: 0.9            # From 0.5
    verify.perform.verification.spawn: 5      # From 3
```

## Command Specialization

### Inheritance Pattern

Each command:
1. Inherits base engine components
2. Declares attitude × aptitude combination
3. Overrides specific parameters
4. Implements unique features

### Command-Specific Overrides

```yaml
# /consider overrides
contract:
  gate: {wait: true, approve: true}
  phases: [CONTEXTUALIZE,SELECT,APPROVE,DISCUSS,FINDINGS,IMPLEMENT]
  
# /confer overrides  
unique_features:
  - spawn_on_uncertainty
  - checkpoint_rollback
  - parallel_chains

# /ponder overrides
visibility_override:
  expert_dialogue: {show: true, format: unified_voice}
```

## Visibility Control System

```yaml
visibility:
  patterns:
    always: "Show regardless of context"
    never: "Hide completely"
    when: "Conditional display"
  
  implementation:
    expert_dialogue:
      consider: {show: always, format: panel}
      confer: {show: always, format: team}
      ponder: {show: always, format: unified}
```

## Verification Architecture

### Multi-Layer Verification

```yaml
verify:
  layers:
    L1: "Logic consistency"
    L2: "Citation validity"
    L3: "Assumption identification"
  
  execution:
    parallel_paths: 3
    voting: "shortest_majority"
    on_failure: "rollback_to_checkpoint"
```

### Checkpoint System

```yaml
checkpointing:
  trigger:
    interval: 3  # exchanges
    events: ["user_interjection", "verification_fail"]
  
  storage:
    includes: ["state", "context", "chains", "experts"]
    excludes: ["temporary_calculations"]
  
  rollback:
    preserves: ["explored_paths", "user_input"]
    resets: ["current_state", "active_chains"]
```

## Linguistic Signal Processing

### Signal Detection Pipeline

```yaml
linguistic_processing:
  detection:
    method: "pattern_matching"
    patterns: "defined_per_signal_type"
  
  adaptation:
    method: "bounded_adjustment"
    max_change: 0.5
    decay_rate: 0.8
    memory_turns: 3
```

### Parameter Adjustment

```yaml
# Example: Complexity signal
on_detect: /(comprehensive|detail|deep)/
adjust:
  depth: +3
  experts: +2
  branch_threshold: -0.2
```

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Lazy State Evaluation
States only manifest when reached, not pre-computed.

### 2. Chain Pruning
Low-confidence chains marked but preserved for transparency.

### 3. Expert Caching
Similar expertise profiles reused within session.

### 4. Parallel Verification
Multiple verification paths run simultaneously.

## Extension Points

### 1. Adding New Commands

```yaml
# new_command.yaml
inherits_from: "../reason/engine.yaml"
metadata:
  attitude: "your_attitude"
  aptitude: "your_aptitude"
unique_features:
  - "your_special_feature"
```

### 2. Creating New Scenes

```yaml
SCENE_CUSTOM:
  description: "Your scene description"
  computational_stance:
    trust_level: 0.X
    verification_depth: "level"
  modifies:
    # Parameter overrides
```

### 3. Extending Metrics

```yaml
new_metric:
  formula: "mathematical_expression"
  behavioral: "CALCULATE_EXACT pattern"
  evidence: "output pattern"
```

## Integration Considerations

### 1. Tool Restrictions
```yaml
phase_tools:
  analysis: [Read, Search, TodoWrite]
  implementation: ALL_TOOLS
```

### 2. Citation Management
```yaml
citation_pipeline:
  collect: "during search"
  format: "^[n] inline"
  footer: "[n]: URL \"Title\""
```

### 3. State Persistence
The system is stateless between invocations but maintains state during execution through output manifestation.

## Debugging and Monitoring

### Debug Mode Activation
```yaml
visibility:
  show_to_user:
    state_transitions: "when:debug_mode"
    uncertainty_calc: "when:debug_mode"
```

### Performance Metrics
- State transition timing
- Expert convergence rate
- Chain branching factor
- Verification success rate

## Best Practices for Extension

1. **Preserve Core Mechanics**: Don't modify base engine mechanics
2. **Use Inheritance**: Extend via YAML anchors, don't duplicate
3. **Maintain Behavioral Paradigm**: Calculations through utterances
4. **Respect Visibility Rules**: Hide complexity appropriately
5. **Test Scene Interactions**: Ensure scenes work with all commands

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Breaking CALCULATE_EXACT**: Always use approved functions
2. **Skipping States**: Maintain proper state flow
3. **Ignoring Guards**: Respect state entry conditions
4. **Citation Shortcuts**: Never fabricate URLs
5. **Visibility Violations**: Follow command-specific rules

## Future Architecture Directions

1. **Plugin System**: Dynamic command loading
2. **Scene Composition**: Multiple active scenes
3. **Metric Learning**: Adaptive threshold adjustment
4. **Chain Persistence**: Cross-session memory
5. **Distributed Experts**: Multi-agent architecture

## Conclusion

The SCENE engine's power comes from its unified approach to language, computation, and behavior. By treating configuration as performance scripts and calculations as behavioral acts, it creates a uniquely flexible and powerful reasoning system. Understanding these implementation details enables both effective use and thoughtful extension of the system.
