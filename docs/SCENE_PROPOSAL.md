# SCENE Enhancement Proposal for the SCENE Engine

## Executive Summary

SCENE (Sequenced Contexts Enabling Narrative Execution) is a proposed enhancement to the SCENE engine that introduces computational context overlays. These overlays modify HOW the AI executes its state machine without changing WHAT the states do, enabling rapid behavioral adaptation for different problem-solving contexts.

## Motivation

Specialists navigating high-stakes problems need AI systems that can rapidly switch between different computational stances:
- **Forensic investigation** requires paranoid verification
- **Emergency response** demands rapid triage
- **Exploratory research** needs creative openness
- **Production deployment** requires conservative validation

Currently, achieving these different modes requires extensive parameter tuning across multiple states. SCENE provides a single control point for comprehensive behavioral modification.

## Core Concept

SCENE introduces orthogonal behavioral overlays that modify all state executions simultaneously:

```yaml
# Without SCENE: Fixed behavior per state
REASON → produces expert dialogue with standard parameters

# With SCENE: Same state, different execution modes
SCENE_FORENSIC + REASON → paranoid expert verification
SCENE_EMERGENCY + REASON → rapid expert consensus
```

## Technical Design

### 1. Grammar Extension

Add to `scene-grammar-spec.txt`:

```ebnf
# New component type
scene_component ::= "x-scene:" anchor_def scene_block
    @behavior: establishes_computational_context
    @constraint: orthogonal_to_states

# Scene definition structure
scene_def ::= scene_name ":" indent scene_spec
scene_spec ::= 
    computational_stance    # Core behavioral parameters
    affects_block          # Which states are modified
    modifies_block         # Parameter overrides
    activity_block?        # Continuous effects
```

### 2. Integration with engine.yaml

```yaml
x-scene: &scene
  # Scene registry
  registry: [
    SCENE_NORMAL,      # Default - current behavior
    SCENE_DIAGNOSTIC,  # Careful exploration
    SCENE_FORENSIC,    # Paranoid verification
    SCENE_EMERGENCY,   # Rapid response
    SCENE_CREATIVE     # Exploratory thinking
  ]
  
  # Scene definitions
  scenes:
    SCENE_FORENSIC:
      description: "Paranoid verification mode for high-stakes investigation"
      
      computational_stance:
        trust_level: 0.1
        verification_depth: "exhaustive"
        assumption_tolerance: 0.0
        evidence_requirement: "multiple_sources"
      
      affects: [CONTEXT, REASON, SYNTHESIS]
      
      modifies:
        # Lower thresholds for uncertainty
        dynamics.uncertainty.fork.threshold: 0.3
        dynamics.uncertainty.spawn.threshold: 0.2
        
        # Increase verification
        dynamics.expert.challenge: 0.9
        verify.perform.verification.spawn: 5
        
        # Stricter evidence requirements
        mechanics.search.trust.domains: [".gov", ".edu", "peer_reviewed"]
        
      activity:
        type: "continuous_anomaly_detection"
        produces: "verification_alerts"
        while_in_states: true
```

### 3. Behavioral Semantics

```yaml
# Scene application rules
scene_application:
  activation:
    trigger: "SCENE_TRANSITION(scene_name)"
    effect: "overlay_modifiers(current_context, scene.modifies)"
    
  execution:
    formula: "state_behavior × scene_modifier = actual_behavior"
    preserves: ["state_flow", "core_mechanics", "output_contracts"]
    
  deactivation:
    trigger: "SCENE_TRANSITION(other_scene)"
    effect: "remove_current_overlay()"
```

### 4. Practical Examples

#### Forensic Investigation
```yaml
# User: "Investigate this security breach"
SCENE_TRANSITION(SCENE_FORENSIC)

# All subsequent states execute with:
# - 90% expert challenge rate
# - 5 parallel verification paths
# - Trust only .gov/.edu sources
# - Continuous anomaly scanning
```

#### Emergency Response
```yaml
# User: "System is down, need immediate diagnosis"
SCENE_TRANSITION(SCENE_EMERGENCY)

# All subsequent states execute with:
# - 3 experts max (faster consensus)
# - 60% confidence threshold (act on less certainty)
# - Skip non-critical verifications
# - Produce action items only
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Extend grammar parser to recognize `x-scene` components
2. Implement scene registry and active scene tracking
3. Create parameter overlay system

### Phase 2: Scene Library
1. Define standard scenes (NORMAL, DIAGNOSTIC, FORENSIC, EMERGENCY, CREATIVE)
2. Test scene transitions during state execution
3. Validate parameter modifications

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Scene composition (combining multiple scenes)
2. Conditional scene activation
3. Scene-specific activities and side effects

## Backward Compatibility

SCENE is fully backward compatible:

1. **Default behavior unchanged**: `SCENE_NORMAL` matches current engine exactly
2. **Opt-in activation**: Scenes only apply when explicitly transitioned
3. **Additive only**: No existing functionality removed or modified
4. **Gradual adoption**: Can introduce scenes incrementally

## Benefits

1. **Rapid Context Switching**: One command changes entire computational stance
2. **Cleaner Architecture**: Separates "what" (states) from "how" (scenes)
3. **Better Testability**: Same state flow can be tested under different scenes
4. **Intuitive Mental Model**: Specialists understand "same process, different mode"
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Avoids parameter explosion across states

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Parameter conflicts | Clear precedence rules: state defaults → scene modifiers |
| Cognitive overhead | Limited scene registry, clear naming conventions |
| Performance impact | Scenes modify parameters, not execution path |
| Testing complexity | Scene-aware test harness, standardized scene library |

## Future Extensions

1. **Dynamic Scene Generation**: Create custom scenes for specific domains
2. **Scene Learning**: Adapt scene parameters based on outcomes
3. **Multi-Scene Composition**: Blend multiple scenes with weights
4. **Scene Triggers**: Automatic scene transitions based on conditions

## Conclusion

SCENE provides a powerful abstraction for behavioral modification without compromising the elegant simplicity of the current engine. By treating computational context as an orthogonal concern to state flow, we enable specialists to rapidly adapt AI behavior to their specific problem-solving needs.
