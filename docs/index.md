# Welcome to INDRA

INDRA is not a programming language; it is a protocol for transforming a Large Language Model (LLM) into a specific, stateful, and interactive conversational actor. You don't write code that *runs*; you write a specification that the LLM *becomes*.

This documentation is designed to be your guide on a journey into a new way of thinking about and interacting with artificial intelligence. It's a resource for developers, thinkers, and creators who feel that the current prompt-and-response model is only scratching the surface of what's possible.

The goal here is to provide a clear, conceptually-grounded path to understanding INDRA, from its core philosophy to its technical implementation.
