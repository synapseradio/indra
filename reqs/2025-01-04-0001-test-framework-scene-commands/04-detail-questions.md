# Detail Questions

## Q1: Should the framework validate CALCULATE_EXACT behavioral patterns from engine.yaml?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (calculation performances are core behavioral contracts in SCENE)

## Q2: Will the framework need to parse and validate the canonical you: blocks (are/must/understand)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (these blocks define behavioral contracts that tests should verify)

## Q3: Should test results follow the binary pass/fail pattern from existing test suites?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (consistency with existing test suite patterns aids adoption)

## Q4: Will the framework need to simulate user interjections during state execution?
**Default if unknown:** No (static testing of outputs is simpler than interactive simulation)

## Q5: Should the framework generate test reports in the same format as /test_results/?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintaining consistent reporting format across the codebase)
