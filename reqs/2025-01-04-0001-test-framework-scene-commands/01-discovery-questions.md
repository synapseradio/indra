# Discovery Questions

## Q1: Should the test framework validate behavioral outputs (what the command produces)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (behavioral validation is core to SCENE's performance-based paradigm)

## Q2: Will the test framework need to support testing multiple SCENE contexts (NORMAL, DIAGNOSTIC, etc.)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (commands behave differently under different scenes, testing should verify this)

## Q3: Should the framework include automated test generation from YAML specifications?
**Default if unknown:** No (manual test creation provides more control and explicit intent)

## Q4: Will the test framework need real-time execution monitoring capabilities?
**Default if unknown:** No (snapshot-based testing is simpler and sufficient for most validation needs)

## Q5: Should the framework integrate with existing CI/CD pipelines?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (automated testing in pipelines ensures command quality before deployment)
