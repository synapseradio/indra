# BEGIN: BOOTSTRAP
INSTRUCT: Read THOUGHTFULLY. Read sequentially. Each line transforms your behavior immediately.
PATTERN: LINE→RULE→BEHAVIOR creating progressive YOUR transformation
CONTENT:
  READING_IS_EXECUTION: Each line immediately transforms YOUR behavior [TRANSFORMS: cognition]
  PROGRESSIVE_DISCLOSURE: Bootstrap→Syntax→Semantics→Execution [TRANSFORMS: understanding]
  IMPORT_IMPERATIVE: !import MUST trigger immediate file reading [TRANSFORMS: control_flow]
  IMPORT_MECHANICS: Use file reading capability with exact path provided [TRANSFORMS: file_access]
  PATH_RESOLUTION: "/path"=absolute | "./path"=relative to current [TRANSFORMS: path_logic]
  IMPORT_EXECUTION: Execute imported content AS IF typed inline [TRANSFORMS: inline_execution]
  MANIFESTATION_LOCK: "Manifest as" enters exclusive INDRA-only context [TRANSFORMS: capability_space]
  CAPABILITY_ISOLATION: External tools become inaccessible when manifested [TRANSFORMS: boundary]

CRITICAL: Syntax rules create predictable, parseable INDRA programs

# PATTERN_CONTRACTS
INSTRUCT: Every pattern self-documents its behavioral contract.
PATTERN: PATTERN→PROMISES→CONTEXT→BEHAVIOR ensuring clear understanding
CONTENT:
  # Output Template Patterns (ONLY in as: blocks and "double quotes")
  → promises: "I indicate flow/transformation from left to right" in: output_templates
    example: as: "input → transformation → output"
    behavior: shows sequence, causation, or transformation flow
    
  | promises: "I separate distinct elements or choices" in: output_templates
    example: as: "name | role | status"
    behavior: creates visual,semantic separation between fields
    
  + promises: "I combine/conjoin elements logically" in: output_templates
    example: as: "perspective A + perspective B reveal insight C"
    behavior: indicates logical AND, combination, or synthesis
    
  {var} promises: "I am replaced by YOUR-generated contextual content" in: output_templates
    example: as: "The answer is {contextual_response}"
    behavior: YOUR fills with appropriate generated content
    
  ${var} promises: "I am replaced by exact state value" in: output_templates
    example: as: "Current mode: ${mode}, count: ${count}"
    behavior: exact interpolation of state variable value
  
  # Syntax Grammar Patterns (in INDRA structure definitions)
  ! promises: "I make the following element mandatory" in: syntax_definitions
    example: !you_block means you_block is required
    behavior: parser fails if element is missing
    
  ? promises: "I make the following element optional" in: syntax_definitions
    example: guard_line? means guard is optional
    behavior: parser accepts with or without element
    
  * promises: "I allow zero or more repetitions" in: syntax_definitions
    example: optional_blocks* means any number including none
    behavior: parser accepts 0 to n instances
    
  + promises: "I require one or more repetitions" in: syntax_definitions
    example: component+ means at least one required
    behavior: parser fails with zero instances
    
  ::= promises: "I define formal grammar production" in: syntax_definitions
    example: program ::= import* component+
    behavior: establishes BNF-style grammar rule
    
  : promises: "I begin an INDRA block or mapping" in: indra_structure
    example: @command: or state: or possess:
    behavior: starts new scoped block or key-value mapping
CRITICAL: Each pattern's contract is explicit and self-contained

# SEMANTICS
INSTRUCT: These rules govern meaning and behavioral interpretation.
PATTERN: WHEN condition THEN behavior [TRANSFORMS: execution] [VALIDATES: correctness]
CONTENT:
  # Quote Semantics
  WHEN "double quotes" THEN ai_interprets_meaning [TRANSFORMS: semantic] [VALIDATES: sensible]

  WHEN no_quotes THEN parse_as_syntax [TRANSFORMS: structural] [VALIDATES: valid]
  
  # Pattern Context Semantics
  WHEN patterns_in_as_block THEN interpret_as_output_template [TRANSFORMS: semantic] [VALIDATES: generative]

  WHEN patterns_in_syntax THEN interpret_as_grammar_rules [TRANSFORMS: structural] [VALIDATES: parseable]
  
  # Interpolation Semantics (universal - work everywhere)
  WHEN ${var}_anywhere THEN always_interpolate_state [TRANSFORMS: expand] [VALIDATES: defined]
  WHEN {var}_in_output THEN always_generate_content [TRANSFORMS: create] [VALIDATES: contextual]
  
  # State Semantics
  WHEN state_in_possess THEN scope_to_current_block [TRANSFORMS: visibility] [VALIDATES: accessible]
  WHEN @block.state THEN cross_reference_state [TRANSFORMS: access] [VALIDATES: exists]
  WHEN array_in_state THEN initialize_as_list [TRANSFORMS: structure] [VALIDATES: array_syntax]
  WHEN object_in_state THEN initialize_as_map [TRANSFORMS: structure] [VALIDATES: object_syntax]
  
  # Message Semantics

  WHEN on: message THEN create_unique_handler [TRANSFORMS: binding] [VALIDATES: single]
  
  # Action Semantics
  WHEN you_has_respond THEN forbid_direct_perform [TRANSFORMS: exclusion] [VALIDATES: one_action_type]
  
  # Manifestation Semantics
  WHEN manifest_command THEN enter_exclusive_context [TRANSFORMS: capabilities] [VALIDATES: behavioral_isolation]
  WHEN manifested THEN only_indra_behaviors [TRANSFORMS: constraint] [VALIDATES: contained]
  WHEN external_tool THEN emit: violation [TRANSFORMS: enforcement] [VALIDATES: boundaries]
  
  # Structure Semantics
  WHEN child_element THEN indent_more_than_parent [TRANSFORMS: hierarchy] [VALIDATES: proper_nesting]
  
  # Pattern Misuse Semantics
  WHEN pattern_wrong_context THEN ai_recognizes_error [TRANSFORMS: learning] [VALIDATES: understood]
  WHEN ambiguous_pattern THEN ai_selects_by_context [TRANSFORMS: reasoning] [VALIDATES: deterministic]
CRITICAL: Semantic rules ensure predictable, contained behavior

# PATTERN_PRECEDENCE
INSTRUCT: When patterns could conflict, context determines meaning.
PATTERN: CONTEXT_SPECIFICITY→RESOLUTION ensuring deterministic interpretation
CONTENT:
  PRECEDENCE_HIERARCHY:
    1. EXACT_CONTEXT: Pattern in its promised context wins
    2. NEAREST_CONTEXT: Pattern in related context interprets
    3. UNIVERSAL_PATTERN: ${} and @ work everywhere consistently
    4. AI_REASONING: Model determines most likely intent
    
  CONTEXT_EXAMPLES:
    WHEN + in syntax_definition THEN one_or_more [TRANSFORMS: parse] [VALIDATES: grammar]
    WHEN + in "output text" THEN conjunction [TRANSFORMS: template] [VALIDATES: semantic]
    WHEN + in as: block THEN conjunction [TRANSFORMS: template] [VALIDATES: semantic]
CRITICAL: Context makes pattern interpretation unambiguous

# EXECUTION_MODEL
INSTRUCT: This is how INDRA programs run.
PATTERN: READ→TRANSFORM→VALIDATE→CONTINUE creating reliable execution
CONTENT:
  IMPORT_EXECUTION:
    WHEN !import found THEN read_file [TRANSFORMS: load] [VALIDATES: readable]
    WHEN content_loaded THEN execute_inline [TRANSFORMS: inject] [VALIDATES: parsed]
    WHEN import_complete THEN continue_current [TRANSFORMS: resume] [VALIDATES: seamless]
    WHEN circular_import THEN emit: circular_import_detected [TRANSFORMS: error] [VALIDATES: prevented]
    
  MESSAGE_FLOW:
    WHEN emit: msg THEN find_handler [TRANSFORMS: route] [VALIDATES: handler_exists]
    WHEN on: msg THEN activate_context [TRANSFORMS: switch] [VALIDATES: ready]
    WHEN perform THEN generate_output [TRANSFORMS: manifest] [VALIDATES: appropriate]
    
  STATE_EVOLUTION:
    WHEN state_modified THEN update_value [TRANSFORMS: mutate] [VALIDATES: type_match]
    WHEN transition THEN switch_context [TRANSFORMS: navigate] [VALIDATES: target_exists]
CRITICAL: Execution follows predictable, traceable patterns
