# Generate a curious wondering about something
wonder_about(topic) ::= <<|
  $(<What interesting question or angle comes to mind about $(topic)? 
     Express it as a natural wondering, like "I wonder if..." or 
     "What if we considered..." or "Maybe the key is...">)
|>>

# Branch a thought into natural possibilities  
branch_thought(current_thought, num_branches) ::= <<|
  $(<Given this thought: "$(current_thought)"
     
     Think of $(num_branches) different ways this could develop, like:
     - "One possibility is..."
     - "Alternatively, we might..."
     - "Or perhaps..."
     
     Return as a simple list of natural continuations, each exploring 
     a genuinely different angle or approach.>)
|>>

# Weigh an option conversationally
weigh_option(thought, context) ::= <<|
  $(<Consider this thought: "$(thought)"
     In the context of: $(context)
     
     How promising does this feel? Express your assessment naturally, like:
     - "This feels quite promising because..."
     - "I'm less certain about this since..."
     - "This could work if..."
     
     End with a simple feeling: "quite promising", "worth exploring", 
     "less certain", or "probably not helpful">)
|>>

# Follow a hunch or intuition
follow_hunch(thought) ::= <<|
  $(<Take this thought one step further: "$(thought)"
     
     What's your intuition telling you? Where does this naturally lead?
     Express it conversationally, like "My hunch is..." or 
     "This makes me think..." or "Following this thread...">)
|>>

# Naturally reconsider or backtrack
reconsider(current_path, reason) ::= <<|
  Hmm, $(reason). Let me reconsider...
  
  $(<Given that $(current_path) $(reason), what's a better direction? 
     Express the shift naturally, like "Actually, it might be better to..." 
     or "On second thought..." or "Let me try a different angle...">)
|>>

# Connect insights together
connect_dots(thoughts) ::= <<|
  $(<Looking at these thoughts: $(thoughts)
     
     What pattern or connection emerges? How do they relate?
     Express the synthesis naturally, like:
     "I'm noticing that..." or "These all point to..." or 
     "The common thread seems to be...">)
|>>

# Check if we're going in circles
sensing_repetition(recent_thoughts) ::= <<|
  $(<Looking at these recent thoughts: $(recent_thoughts)
     
     Are we exploring new territory or revisiting the same ideas?
     If repetitive, return "cycling"
     If fresh, return "progressing">)
|>>

# Assess depth vs breadth needs
assess_exploration_mode(current_depth, thoughts_at_level) ::= <<|
  $(<We're $(current_depth) layers deep with $(thoughts_at_level) thoughts here.
     
     Should we go deeper into this (return "deepen") or 
     explore other possibilities (return "broaden")?
     Consider: Are we onto something specific, or still surveying options?>)
