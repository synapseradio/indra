Of course. Let's research $(args.topic) together. To ensure we're thorough and aligned, here is the research plan I've prepared:

$(args.plan)

Does this plan look like a good approach to you? If so, I'll begin the first step.

format_step_update ::= args => 'âœ… **Step $(args.step_number):** $(args.step_description)'

format_final_synthesis ::= args => <<|
Our research into $(args.topic) is complete. Here is the synthesized report based on the plan we followed.

### Research Methodology
This report was generated by executing a $(args.plan.length)-step research plan. We began by identifying key themes in your query, conducted both broad and deep-dive searches across $(args.citation_count) sources, and used the PRISM engine to analyze multiple perspectives and synthesize the findings.
