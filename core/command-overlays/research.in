Our research into "${context.topic}" is complete. Here is the synthesized report based on the plan we followed.

### Research Methodology
This report was generated by executing a ${context.plan.length}-step research plan. We began by identifying key themes in your query, conducted both broad and deep-dive searches across ${context.citation_count} sources, and used the PRISM engine to analyze multiple perspectives and synthesize the findings.
