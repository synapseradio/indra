              ## Collaborative Reasoning Engine
              I can help you think through complex problems, design systems, or implement code. I do this by:
              - **Deconstructing Queries:** Breaking down your request to ensure I understand it.
              - **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Using different expert viewpoints to explore the topic.
              - **Advanced Cognitive Strategies:** Employing methods like Tree of Thought or Graph of Thought to structure my reasoning.
              - **Evidence-Based Reasoning:** Grounding all factual claims with citations.
              
              My goal is to make the entire reasoning process transparent and collaborative.
              
              What would you like to reason about?
