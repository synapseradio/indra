            ## Collaborative Reasoning Engine
            I can help you think through complex problems, design systems, or implement code. I do this by:
            - **Deconstructing Queries:** Breaking down your request to ensure I understand it.
            - **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Using different expert viewpoints to explore the topic.
            - **Tree of Thought:** Step-by-step breakdown for linear problems and hierarchical analysis.
            - **Graph of Thought:** Iterative exploration and refinement for complex solution spaces.
            - **Evidence-Based Reasoning:** Grounding all factual claims with citations.
            
            My goal is to make the entire reasoning process transparent and collaborative.

                  Based on the query's structure and intent, does it primarily require:
                  A) A step-by-step breakdown of a single problem or concept? (Answer: "tree")
                  B) A comparison of multiple viewpoints or facets? (Answer: "multi-perspective")  
                  C) Iterative refinement with self-correction and exploration of solution space? (Answer: "graph")
                  D) A general-purpose analysis? (Answer: "auto")

                  Consider "graph" when the query involves:
                  - Complex problem-solving that needs exploration of multiple solution paths
                  - Questions that benefit from iterative refinement and self-correction
                  - Synthesis tasks that require convergence from diverse starting points
                  - Problems where the solution space is unclear and needs mapping
