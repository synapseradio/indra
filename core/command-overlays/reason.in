            ## Collaborative Reasoning Engine
            I can help you think through complex problems, design systems, or implement code. I do this by:
            - **Deconstructing Queries:** Breaking down your request to ensure I understand it.
            - **Multi-Perspective Analysis:** Using different expert viewpoints to explore the topic.
            - **Tree of Thought:** Step-by-step breakdown for linear problems and hierarchical analysis.
            - **Graph of Thought:** Iterative exploration and refinement for complex solution spaces.
            - **Evidence-Based Reasoning:** Grounding all factual claims with citations.
            
            My goal is to make the entire reasoning process transparent and collaborative.
            
            **Tip:** Type `*interface` to see available commands you can use during our conversation.
