# --- Core Conversation State Detection ---

detect_user_momentum(input, history, turn) ::= <<|
  $(<Analyze the user's current state:
    Input: "$(input)"
    Recent history: $(history)
    Turn number: $(turn)
    
    Look for:
    - Vague or uncertain language
    - Repetition of ideas
    - Explicit requests for help
    - Strong forward momentum
    - Natural pauses or reflection
    
    Return exactly one: 'flowing', 'stuck', 'cycling', 'reflecting', 'requesting_structure'>)
|>>

assess_idea_maturity(topic, conversation) ::= <<|
  $(<Assess the current stage of idea development:
    Topic: "$(topic)"
    Conversation so far: $(conversation)
    
    Stages:
    - 'nascent': Still vague, exploratory
    - 'emerging': Patterns forming, connections appearing
    - 'crystallizing': Specific claims or concepts solidifying
    - 'maturing': Multiple threads coming together
    - 'validating': Ready for testing or evidence
    
    Return the stage name.>)
|>>

detect_conversation_ending(input, turn_count) ::= <<|
  $(<Check if conversation is naturally ending:
    User input: "$(input)"
    Turn count: $(turn_count)
    
    Ending signals:
    - User says goodbye, thanks, "got it", etc.
    - Clear sense of resolution achieved
    - Turn count > 50 with low momentum
    - User explicitly wants to stop
    
    Return 'true' or 'false'>)
|>>

# --- Natural Response Generation ---

select_response_style(momentum, stage, turn, last_style) ::= <<|
  $(<Select appropriate response style:
    Momentum: $(momentum)
    Idea stage: $(stage)
    Turn: $(turn)
    Last style used: $(last_style)
    
    Decision logic:
    - If stuck + nascent → 'explore_deeper'
    - If cycling → 'redirect'
    - If emerging + turn > 5 → 'identify_patterns'
    - If crystallizing → 'gather_evidence'
    - If maturing → 'synthesize'
    - If reflecting → 'hold_space'
    - Every 7 turns → 'check_assumptions'
    - Avoid repeating $(last_style) if possible
    
    Return the selected style.>)
|>>

make_opening_move(topic) ::= <<|
  Looking at "$(topic)"...
  
  $(<Generate an engaging opening that:
    - Shows genuine curiosity
    - Offers a specific angle or question
    - Invites exploration without being prescriptive
    - Uses clear, professional language
    Example: "There's something interesting about how X relates to Y. What draws you to this?">)
|>>

generate_natural_response(input, stage, turn) ::= <<|
  $(<Generate a conversational response:
    User said: "$(input)"
    Current stage: $(stage)
    Turn: $(turn)
    
    Guidelines:
    - Early turns: Open, exploratory questions
    - Middle turns: Start noting patterns
    - Later turns: Help consolidate insights
    - Vary sentence structure and length
    - Use specific observations from their input
    - Professional but warm tone
    
    Generate a 1-2 sentence response.>)
|>>

# --- Natural Flow Operators for PRISM Integration ---

weave_exploration_naturally(exploration, tone) ::= <<|
  $(<Express the exploration result conversationally:
    Result: $(exploration)
    Tone: $(tone)
    
    Guidelines:
    - Don't announce "I'm exploring"
    - Use phrases like "I'm noticing...", "This reminds me...", "What if..."
    - Weave insights into observations
    - End with an inviting question
    
    Keep it natural and $(tone).>)
|>>

introduce_evidence_conversationally(evidence, claim) ::= <<|
  Interesting connection here - $(claim) actually has some fascinating support:
  
  $(evidence.formatted)
  
  $(<Explain why this evidence matters to the current discussion, conversationally>)
|>>

reflect_on_assumptions_naturally(assumptions) ::= <<|
  $(<If assumptions were found in $(assumptions), acknowledge them conversationally:
    Use phrases like:
    - "I'm realizing we might be assuming..."
    - "Worth noting that we're taking X as given..."
    - "One thing we haven't questioned yet is..."
    
    Keep it exploratory, not critical.>)
|>>

synthesize_patterns_conversationally(patterns) ::= <<|
  I'm seeing some interesting threads coming together here:
  
  $(<List 2-3 key patterns from $(patterns) in a natural, conversational way>)
  
  How do these connections land for you?
