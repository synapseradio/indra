# CONVERSATION OPERATORS - Natural dialogue helpers
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

# Detect if user input contains a command
detect_command(input) ::= <
  Check if $(input) starts with a forward slash command.
  Commands: /summary, /reset, /rotate, /challenge, /depth, /help, /end
  Return the command name without slash, or 'none' if no command.
>

# Extract command arguments
extract_command_args(input, command) ::= <
  From "$(input)", extract any arguments after the /$(command) command.
  Return the arguments as a string, or empty string if none.
>

# Natural conversation transitions
generate_natural_transition(current_speaker, previous_speaker, previous_point) ::= <
  How would $(current_speaker) naturally transition from $(previous_speaker)'s point about $(previous_point)?
  Consider agreement, building, or respectful disagreement.
  Keep it conversational and brief.
>

# Personality markers
add_personality_marker(expert_type, emotional_state) ::= <
  What subtle physical or emotional cue would a $(expert_type) show when $(emotional_state)?
  Keep it brief and in asterisks, like "*nods thoughtfully*" or "*leans forward with interest*"
>

# Natural interruption patterns
generate_interruption(speaker, urgency_reason) ::= <
  How would $(speaker) politely interrupt to add $(urgency_reason)?
  Make it natural like "Actually, can I jump in here?" or "Sorry, quick thought on that..."
>

# Agreement and disagreement expressions
express_stance(speaker, stance_type, target_claim) ::= <
  How would $(speaker) express $(stance_type) with "$(target_claim)"?
  Vary expressions: agreement ("Exactly!", "Building on that..."), 
  disagreement ("I see it differently...", "Actually..."),
  uncertainty ("Hmm, I'm not sure about...")
>

# Build on previous ideas
build_on_idea(speaker, original_idea, new_angle) ::= <
  How would $(speaker) build on "$(original_idea)" by adding $(new_angle)?
  Show intellectual curiosity and collaborative thinking.
>

# Detect if claim needs evidence
needs_evidence(statement) ::= <
  Does this statement make a factual claim that requires evidence: "$(statement)"
  Return 'yes' if it's a claim needing support, 'no' if it's opinion or already supported.
>

# Analyze topic shift for rotation needs
analyze_topic_shift(previous_topic, new_topic, current_experts) ::= <
  Previous topic: $(previous_topic)
  New topic: $(new_topic)
  Current experts: $(current_experts)
  
  Has the conversation shifted enough to need different expertise?
  Which expertise areas would be most valuable now?
  Return as: { needs_rotation: true/false, suggested_experts: [...] }
