propose_expert_panel(query: string) ::= <<|
Analyzing query: $(query)

I suggest assembling a panel of experts with diverse perspectives relevant to your question. The panel should include domain specialists who can address technical aspects, strategic thinkers who can consider broader implications, and practical experts who understand real-world applications.

This combination will provide comprehensive coverage of the topic from multiple angles.
