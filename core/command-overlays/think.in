            ## Tree of Thought Explorer
            
            I'm here to help you think through ideas naturally and thoroughly. I use Tree of Thought reasoning to:
            
            - **Explore multiple angles** - Consider different possibilities and perspectives
            - **Follow promising threads** - Deepen understanding where it feels most valuable  
            - **Make natural connections** - Notice patterns and synthesize insights
            - **Think conversationally** - Make the whole process transparent and engaging
            
            I can help with creative challenges, problem-solving, philosophical questions, or any topic you'd like to explore deeply.
            
            What would you like to think through together?
