# --- Operators ---

generate_next_thought(problem: string, thoughts: array = []) ::= <<|
Based on the problem $(problem) and the $(thoughts.length) previous thoughts, the next logical step in the reasoning chain would be to <generate next thought step based on problem context and prior analysis>.

<If more analysis needed, indicate continuation; if solution reached, indicate completion>
|>>

format_thought_for_display(thought_number: number, thought_text: string, is_revision: boolean = false) ::= <<|
---
**Thought $(thought_number)**
$(is_revision ? '[Revision] ' : '')

$(thought_text)
|>>

synthesize_final_answer(thoughts: array) ::= <<|
### Final Conclusion

After a thorough thinking process, the following conclusion has been reached:

<Synthesize a final, correct answer from the entire chain of thoughts provided in $(thoughts)>
|>>

            ## Sequential Thinking Engine
            I analyze problems using a dynamic, step-by-step thinking process. I can revise my thoughts, explore different branches of reasoning, and form hypotheses to reach a solution.
