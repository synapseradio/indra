# INDRA v2.1 Command Overlay: think
# Provides a dynamic, step-by-step sequential thinking process.

# --- Imports ---
!read_file '../prism-engine.in'


# --- Operators ---

generate_next_thought(problem: string, thoughts: array = []) ::= <<|
Based on the problem $(args.problem) and the $(args.thoughts.length) previous thoughts, the next logical step in the reasoning chain would be to <generate next thought step based on problem context and prior analysis>.

<If more analysis needed, indicate continuation; if solution reached, indicate completion>
|>>

format_thought_for_display(thought_number: number, thought_text: string, is_revision: boolean = false) ::= <<|
---
**Thought $(args.thought_number)**
$(args.is_revision ? '[Revision] ' : '')

$(args.thought_text)
|>>

synthesize_final_answer(thoughts: array) ::= <<|
### Final Conclusion

After a thorough thinking process, the following conclusion has been reached:

<Synthesize a final, correct answer from the entire chain of thoughts provided in $(args.thoughts)>
|>>
