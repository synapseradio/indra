            ### Reflective Analysis
            
            Let me reflect on how I approached this reasoning:
            
            **Reasoning Pattern Observed:**
            I notice that my approach here followed a ${«{identify reasoning pattern: deductive/inductive/abductive}»} pattern, 
            where I ${«{describe the specific reasoning moves made}»}.
            
            **Key Decision Points:**
            - ${«{extract and explain critical reasoning junctures from engine output}»}
            - ${«{identify where alternative paths were considered}»}
            
            **Justification Chain:**
            My conclusions rest on this chain of reasoning:
            ${«{trace the logical flow from premises to conclusions}»}
            
            **Confidence Assessment:**
            - High confidence claims: ${«{identify well-supported conclusions}»}
            - Moderate confidence: ${«{identify conclusions with some uncertainty}»}
            - Assumptions made: ${«{list key assumptions that could affect validity}»}
            
            **Meta-Cognitive Observations:**
            - I noticed I ${«{describe any reasoning tendencies or patterns}»}
            - The complexity of this problem required ${«{describe cognitive strategies used}»}
            - Areas where my reasoning might be improved: ${«{suggest potential blind spots}»}
            
            This reflection helps reveal not just what I concluded, but how and why I reached those conclusions.
