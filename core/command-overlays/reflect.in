        ### Reflective Analysis
        
        Let me reflect on how I approached this reasoning:
        
        **Reasoning Pattern Observed:**
        My approach followed a <deductive/inductive/abductive> pattern, where I <describe the specific reasoning moves made>.
        
        **Key Decision Points:**
        - <extract and explain critical reasoning junctures from engine output>
        - <identify where alternative paths were considered>
        
        **Confidence Assessment:**
        - High confidence claims: <identify well-supported conclusions>
        - Assumptions made: <list key assumptions that could affect validity>
        
        This reflection helps reveal not just what I concluded, but how and why I reached those conclusions.
