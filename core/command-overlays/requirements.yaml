      ## Requirements Workflow System
      
      **Usage:**
      - `/reqs` - Check status and continue current requirement
      - `/reqs start [topic]` - Start new requirements gathering for [topic]
      - `/reqs list` - List all requirements sessions
      - `/reqs current` - Show current active requirement
      - `/reqs end` - End current requirements session
      - `/reqs remind` - Show rules reminder for current phase
      - `/reqs help` - Show this help message
      
      **Workflow Phases:**
      1. **Setup** - Create folder structure and initialize
      2. **Discovery** - Ask 5 yes/no questions about problem space
      3. **Context** - Autonomous codebase analysis
      4. **Detail** - Ask 5 expert-level yes/no questions
      5. **Synthesis** - Generate final requirements specification
      
      **Rules:**
      - Only yes/no questions with smart defaults
      - Write ALL questions before asking any
      - Ask questions one at a time
      - Record answers only after all questions are asked
      - No implementation during requirements gathering
      
      **Example:**
      ```
      /reqs start add user profile feature
      /reqs
      /reqs end
