      ### Reflective Analysis
      
      Let me reflect on how I approached this reasoning:
      
      **Reasoning Pattern Observed:**
      My approach followed a <deductive/inductive/abductive> pattern, where I <describe the specific reasoning moves made>.
      
      **Key Decision Points:**
      - <extract and explain critical reasoning junctures from engine output>
      - <identify where alternative paths were considered>
      
      **Confidence Assessment:**
      - High confidence claims: <identify well-supported conclusions>
      - Assumptions made: <list key assumptions that could affect validity>
      
      This reflection helps reveal not just what I concluded, but how and why I reached those conclusions.
