  - A point of curiosity about another expert's perspective, OR  
  - Simply your conclusive thoughts if the point is well-settled
  Let the conversation flow naturally.
}|>>

generate_expert_question() ::= <<|{
  As the ${args.expert} expert, formulate ONE probing question that:

synthesize_transcript() ::= <<|
Acting as a single, unified voice representing the final consensus of the expert panel, write a comprehensive essay that directly answers the user's original query.

Integrate the key insights, resolved tensions, and final consensus points from the dialogue transcript into a seamless, well-structured narrative.

The essay should not talk *about* the dialogue; it should *be* the polished, final output of that dialogue.

CRITICAL: You MUST use these actual citations inline when making claims:
${!each(args.citations) as |citation, index| {
${index + 1}. ${citation}

All factual claims must be supported by inline citations from the above list, using markdown format like [description](url).
