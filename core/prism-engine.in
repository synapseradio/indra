# DEPRECATED
# This file is a relic of the monolithic PRISM engine.
# All of its functionality has been decoupled into self-contained modules
# within the core/prism/ directory.
#
# Command overlays should now dynamically load the specific modules they need
# using the `read_file:` action at runtime.
