INDRA Protocol Version: 2.2
Grammar Version: 2.2
PRISM Engine Version: 2.2

Release Date: 2025-01-20

Breaking Changes Since 2.1:
  - Unified iteration syntax: !each() removed, use each: only
  - Removed ASSERT constructs (use guards with when/otherwise)
  - Removed REPEAT constructs (use each: with range arrays)
  - Grammar reordered to eliminate forward references

New Features in 2.2:
  - Comment support (# and /* */ syntax)
  - Existence checks: exists(&context.path)
  - Dynamic key access: &context[&key]
  - Unified each: construct works in both templates and actions
  - Cleaner grammar organization with proper dependency ordering

Improvements:
  - All version numbers consistent across modules
  - Grammar productions properly ordered (no forward references)
  - Simplified iteration with single context-aware construct
  - Better error handling semantics for iterations
