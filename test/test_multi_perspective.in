# Expected behavior:
# 1. Epistemic core manages perspective states
# 2. Multiple perspectives instantiated with beliefs and axioms
# 3. Dialectical exchange occurs between perspectives
# 4. Beliefs evolve through argumentation
# 5. Emergent synthesis beyond any single perspective
# 6. Epistemic tracking throughout
